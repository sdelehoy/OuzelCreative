            <h1>Our Digital World Affects Our<br /> Physical World</h1>
						<h2 class="post-subtitle">Part 3: Our Digital Data Creates Pollution</h2>
						<p class="posts-date">April 22, 2024</p>
						<hr class="post-line">
						<p>While it may be surprising how much energy data centers use, the bigger issue is that most of our energy still comes from burning fossil fuels. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.c2es.org/content/renewable-energy/">Only 29% of the worlds electricity was produced by renewable energy in 2020.</a> Not only are fossil fuels a limited resource, but burning them has the unfortunate side affect of releasing carbon dioxide which is a heat trapping gas.</p>
            <p>The rate at which we have been producing CO2, is affecting our planet. The global average temperature has steadily risen in correlation with the amount of CO2 we have added to our atmosphere. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-analysis-confirms-2023-as-warmest-year-on-record/">Last year was the warmest year on record.</a></p>
            <h3 class="post-section-heading">How Much Does Our Digital World Pollute Our Physical World?</h3>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think">The internet accounts for about 3.7% of global carbon emissions,</a> which is close to the amount produced by the airline industry.</p>
            <p>By 2025 <a target="_blank" href="https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-internet-uses-more-electricity-than/">information communication technology will be the 4th largest emitter of carbon</a> only behind China, India and the United States. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com">According to some research</a> we have already reached that prediction.</p>
            <p>To put it another way, <a target="_blank" href="https://gerrymcgovern.com/books/world-wide-waste/">231 million trees would need to be planted to absorb the pollution caused from the data consumed by U.S. citizens alone in 2019.</a></p>
            <p>With all of that said, many data centers have been successfully working to increase efficiency to save energy and water. While those efficiency improvements have kept energy consumption lower than it otherwise would be, the rate at which the internet has been growing is outpacing those gains.</p>
            <p>All of this does not even account for all the hardware that makes the internet possible. Obvious examples are computers, tablets, and phones. It would also include chips and receivers that go into anything that can be connected to the internet, such as smart lightbulbs, washers and dryer, refrigerators, etc. It includes everything on the other end that makes it possible for the internet to come to our homes such as servers, modems, routers, cell phone towers, and all of the hundreds of thousands of miles of cables that crisscross the globe even running along the bottom of the ocean. All of this infrastructure requires physical resources to manufacture, transport, and maintain.</p>
            <p>With all this information, one should not become despondent nor think the only solution is to return to the pre-digital filing cabinet world. Technology is here to stay and has brought with it many useful tools. Some of these tools are even helping us become more sustainable. However, we need to keep in mind the impact of the digital world and use these digital tools responsibly and efficiently.</p>
