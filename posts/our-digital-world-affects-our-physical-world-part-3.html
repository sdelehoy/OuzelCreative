            <h1>Our Digital World Affects Our<br /> Physical World</h1>
						<h2 class="post-subtitle">Part 3: Our Digital Data Creates Pollution</h2>
						<p class="posts-date">April 22, 2024</p>
						<hr class="post-line">
						<p>While it may be surprising how much energy data centers use, the bigger issue is that most of our energy still comes from burning fossil fuels. Only 29% of the worlds electricity was produced by renewable energy in 2020. Not only are fossil fuels a limited resource, but burning them has the unfortunate side affect of releasing carbon dioxide which is a heat trapping gas.</p>
            <p>The rate at which we have been producing CO2, is affecting our planet. The global average temperature has steadily risen in correlation with the amount of CO2 we have added to our atmosphere. Last year was the warmest year on record.</p>
