              <p>
                If you've ever rolled your eyes at the idea of business cards
                thinking they're a waste of paper, you're not alone. In an age
                where we can just tap phones or scan QR codes, why bother with a
                tiny piece of paper? Well, hold onto your reusable coffee cup
                because we're about to drop some truth bombs on why physical
                business cards still slay at networking events.
              </p>
              <p>
                Have you thought to yourself that business cards are a waste of
                paper? Spoiler alert: They don’t have to be! And even if they
                may seem outdated, the benefits might just change your mind.
                Let’s dive in.
              </p>
              <h2 class="post-section-heading">
                The 3 Reasons Business Cards Still Matter in 2026
              </h2>
              <h3 class="post-section-heading">
                1. They Make a Lasting First Impression
              </h3>
              <p>
                Sure, you could just hand someone your phone and say, "Add your
                contact!" But let’s be real—nothing says "I’m professional and
                prepared" like a sleek, well-designed business card. A physical
                card is a tangible reminder of you long after the event is over.
                A tactile card creates an experience that says something about
                your expertise, and that feeling is attached to something real.
                It sits on a desk, gets tucked into a wallet, or even becomes a
                bookmark (we’ve all done it).
              </p>
              <h4>
                Digital Alternatives (QR codes, phone contacts, etc.) vs.
                Physical Cards
              </h4>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    QR codes are quick, but they require the other person to have
                    their phone out and be willing to scan it. Not everyone’s
                    comfortable with that.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Phone contacts are easy, but they lack personality and are
                    soon lost in a cloud of names. A business card can include a
                    memorable tagline, all your social handles, or even a
                    handwritten note—things that don’t translate to a digital
                    exchange.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                PRO TIP: If you’re worried about waste, opt for a minimalist
                design with recycled paper or even seed paper that can be
                planted later. More on that in a sec!
              </p>
              <h3 class="post-section-heading">
                2. They Keep the Conversation Flowing
              </h3>
              <p>Networking events are all about energy—you don’t want to kill the vibe by fumbling with your phone while someone’s mid-sentence. Worse yet, a tech fail will sap valuable time to make an impression and quickly distract from connection. Handing over a business card is a smooth, low-pressure way to exchange info without interrupting the flow of conversation.</p>
              <h4>
                Digital Alternatives (QR codes, phone contacts, etc.) vs.
                Physical Cards
              </h4>
              <ul><li>QR codes can feel impersonal, like you’re just handing out a link instead of a real connection.</li>
              <li>Phone contacts require the other person to stop what they’re doing, type, and confirm—awkward! </li>
              <li>A business card, on the other hand, is a seamless way to say, "Let’s keep this conversation going!" without derailing the moment or forcing your way into someone’s personal contact list.</li></ul>
              <h3 class="post-section-heading">
                3. They're a Subtle Power Move
              </h3>
              <p>Here’s the thing: People notice when you’re prepared. Showing up with a business card signals that you take networking seriously,and that you’re someone worth remembering. It’s a small but mighty way to stand out in a sea of LinkedIn profiles.</p>
              <h4>
                Digital Alternatives (QR codes, phone contacts, etc.) vs. Physical Cards
              </h4>
              <ul><li>QR codes can feel gimmicky if not done right.</li>
              <li>Phone contacts are forgettable—how many times have you added someone’s info, only to never message them?</li>
              <li>A business card, though? It’s a physical keepsake that lives in someone’s wallet or desk drawer, reminding them of your awesome conversation.</li></ul>
              <h2 class="post-section-heading">
                Bonus: How to Choose Eco-Friendly Business Cards
              </h2>
              <p>Okay, so you’re convinced—business cards are still a networking must-have. But how do you make them sustainable? Here’s what to look for:</p>


              <p>
                <span class="bold">Recycle Electronic Devices</span>—If possible
                repair electronic devices and continue using them, or pass them
                on or sell them to someone who can use it. If they are passed
                their usable life, have them properly recycled by a certified
                recycler <a href="#resources">(see resources below)</a>. Devices
                contain toxic materials as well as precious and heavy metals.

                Ways Businesses Can Reduce Their Digital Footprint
              </h2>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Switch to Green Hosting</span>—If you own a
                website, choose a website hosting provider/cloud service that
                uses renewable energy.
                <a href="#resources">(see resources below)</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Optimize SEO</span>—By optimizing for search
                engines on your website it helps people find what they are
                looking for on the internet quickly. It can reduce the amount of
                time and web pages during a person's search so that it uses less
                energy.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Improve User Experience</span>—One of the
                main goals of good user experience for a website is making the
                user journey as streamlined as possible. Intuitive navigation
                and easy to find information that people are searching for
                reduces energy wasted.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</span>—A
                CDN is a network of servers around the globe that allow you to
                cache your website files from your hosting provider closer to
                where your users are located. The less distanced data travels
                the less energy used. An added benefit is that it provides
                another layer of security.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Reduce Animations</span>—Implementing
                animations on your website uses computer processing and thereby
                uses more power.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Consider Vector Images</span>—<a
                  target="_blank"
                  href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/comparison/raster-vs-vector.html"
                  >Vector images</a
                >, such as SVG format, are generally smaller in file size than
                equivalent raster images. Assets on your website, such as logos,
                icons, and illustrations, can be a vector. Vectors also have the
                advantage of being able to be used in various sizes without
                pixelation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Reduce Website Tracking</span>—Cancel
                analytics tracking on your website if you are not using the
                collected data.
              </p>
