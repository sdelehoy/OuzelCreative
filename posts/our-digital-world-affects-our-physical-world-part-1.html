            </h1>
						<p class="posts-date">April 22, 2024</p>
						<hr class="post-line">
						<p>You've heard the common phrase, “Out of sight, out of mind.” But have you ever thought about all of the digital data that you accumulate year after year? It is easy to think that all of this data, because it is digital, doesn’t really exist or to simply not think about it at all.</p>
						<p>It used to be that we had file cabinets and boxes that stored all the information that we now put on our computers and store in the cloud—documents, pictures, etc. Back then, it was hard not to notice the stacks of papers sitting around that you had to move or find a physical place to store them. It was hard not to notice when your files ran out of room or you had to add another box to the collection. The clutter of it all visually overflows in front of your eyes.</p>
						<p>Maybe some still have those overflowing boxes, but now we have technology which can alleviate that problem. We don't always need to have printed versions of documents and pictures can now be stored on our computer, social media or the cloud. It does save a lot of paper being able to send emails or to direct people to a website rather than printing out numerous brochures. It would be easy to think of digital data as being "green” since there seems to be no physical product.</p>
						<p>While we have reduced the need for storing physical files in cabinets, what we have replaced them with are data centers—giant filing cabinets for all things digital. These centers are where the internet is stored, the cloud resides, and where computing is done for many digital services that we commonly use. While they are out of sight they should not be out of mind.</p>
