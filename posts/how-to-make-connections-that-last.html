                Networking events can feel like walking into a room full of
                strangers where everyone already knows the secret handshake. But
                here’s the truth: everyone is there to connect. The trick?
                Breaking the ice without freezing up.

                Whether you're at a meetup, a conference, or a local networking
                fair, two skills will make you a networking superstar:
              </p>
              <ol class="list">
                <li>Active Listening (Don't do all the talking)</li>
                <li>Showing Your Interest (Keep the conversation going)</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Master these, and you’ll never dread small talk again. Let’s
                dive in!

                Skill 1: Active Listening (Because Nobody Likes a Monologue)
              </h2>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Why It Matters:</span> People love talking
                about themselves—but only if they feel heard. If you’re doing
                all the talking, you’re missing out on building real
                connections.

                  Eye contact (put your phone away!)
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <span class="bold">What to do:</span> Look at the person's
                      eyes (not their shoes, not your phone).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span class="bold">Why it works:</span> It shows you’re
                      engaged and makes them feel valued.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span class="bold">Pro tip:</span> If eye contact feels
                      intense, try looking at their eyebrows or nose—close
                      enough!

                    <li>
                      <span class="bold">What to do:</span> Smile naturally (no
                      creepy grins).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span class="bold">Why it works:</span> It makes you
                      approachable and puts the other person at ease.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span class="bold">Pro tip:</span> Smiling actually tricks
                      your brain into feeling happier—win-win!

                    <li>
                      <span class="bold">What to do:</span> Uncross your arms,
                      nod occasionally, lean in slightly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span class="bold">Why it works:</span> Open body language
                      signals you’re interested and confident.

                    <li>

                    <li>
                      <span class="bold">What to do:</span> Reflect back what
                      they’re saying. "That sounds challenging—how did you
                      handle it?"

                    <li>
                      <span class="bold">Why it works:</span> It shows you’re

                    <li>
                      <span class="bold">Pro tip:</span> Avoid jumping in with

                Breaking the ice gets easier with practice. Start small—chat
                with the person next to you in line, ask a speaker a question,
                or compliment someone’s reusable cup.
