                Let’s be real—networking can feel like a transactional game. You
                meet someone, exchange business cards, and then… crickets. But
                what if I told you there’s a better way? A way to build real
                relationships that last?
              </p>
              <p>The secret? Adding value.</p>
              <p>
                In a world that often feels greedy and self-serving, being the
                person who helps others is a superpower. And guess what? People
                remember—and reciprocate—those who genuinely support them.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, how do you add value in networking? Let’s break it down.
              </p>
              <h2 class="post-section-heading">
                The Problem: Networking Feels Like a One-Way Street
              </h2>
              <p>
                Most people approach networking with "What can you do for me?"
                on their minds. But here’s the truth: People are more likely to
                work with those who help them solve problems. If you’re only
                thinking about what you can get, you’re missing out on what you
                can give.
              </p>
              <h2 class="post-section-heading">
                The Solution: Be the Person Who Adds Value
              </h2>
              <h3 class="post-subheading-3">Ask, "How can I support you?"</h3>
              <p>Instead of pitching yourself, ask how you can help.</p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Example:</span> "I’d love to support your
                work—what’s one thing you’re focusing on right now?"
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Why it works:</span> It shows you care and
                opens the door for collaboration.
              </p>
              <h3 class="post-subheading-3">
                Follow or Connect on Social Media
              </h3>
              <p>
                If you meet someone interesting, follow them on LinkedIn or
                Instagram.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Example:</span> "I’d love to stay in
                touch—let’s connect on LinkedIn!"
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Why it works:</span> It keeps the
                conversation going and shows you’re invested.
              </p>
              <h3 class="post-subheading-3">Make a Referral</h3>
              <p>
                Know someone who’d be a great fit for their project? Introduce
                them!
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Example:</span> "I know someone working on
                [topic]—would you like an intro?"
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Why it works:</span> Referrals build trust
                and strengthen relationships.
              </p>
              <h3 class="post-subheading-3">Share Useful Information</h3>
              <p>
                See an article, tool, or resource that could help them? Send it
                over!
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Example:</span> "I came across this
                sustainability report—thought you’d find it helpful!"
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Why it works:</span> You’re positioning
                yourself as a go-to resource.
              </p>
              <h3 class="post-subheading-3">Offer a Unique Perspective</h3>
              <p>If they’re struggling with a problem, share your insights.</p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Example:</span> "I faced something
                similar—here’s what worked for me."
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Why it works:</span> You’re not just
                talking—you’re solving problems.
              </p>
              <h2 class="post-section-heading">
                The Bonus: You Become a Super Connector
              </h2>
              <p>
                When you focus on adding value, something magical happens:
                People remember you. Opportunities come back to you. You build a
                stronger network.
              </p>
              <p>And stronger networks? They build stronger communities.</p>
              <h2 class="post-section-heading">
                Final Thought: Networking Isn't About Taking—It's About Giving
              </h2>
              <p>
                The next time you’re at a networking event, ask yourself: "How
                can I help this person?” Shift your mindset from "What can I
                get?" to "What can I give?" and watch your network grow in ways
                you never expected.
              </p>
