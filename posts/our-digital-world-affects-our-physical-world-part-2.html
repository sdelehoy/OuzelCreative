						<p class="posts-date">April 22, 2024</p>

						<p>What you may not realize is how much of our resources data centers use. Data centers use large amounts of water to cool servers. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/04/25/data-centers-drought-water-use/">A large data center uses between 1-5 million gallons of water per day.</a></p>
            <p>The western US, where we live, has been plagued with droughts over the last couple of decades. States, cities, and farmers are reevaluating water usage and battling for water rights as rivers and reservoirs are not able to provide the same amount of water. <a target="_blank" href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/03/25/as-demand-for-data-centers-grows-so-do-concerns-over-their-effects-on-colorados-environment/">People in our region are now discussing where the water will come from</a> as the number of data centers increase to meet the demand of our ever expanding digital world.</p>
            <p>Data centers also use massive amounts of energy. Every time we send an email, enter an internet search, visit a website, and use a web app a little energy is being used to process and send the data across the globe. With so many people around the world using the internet it quickly adds up. <a target="_blank" href="https://energyinnovation.org/2020/03/17/how-much-energy-do-data-centers-really-use/">Some of the largest data centers can use as much electricity as 80,000 households.</a></p>
            <p>With the burgeoning of Artificial Intelligence (AI) energy demands will quickly increase. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/ai-uses-a-lot-of-energy-experts-expect-it-to-double-in-just-a-few-years">A single Google search takes about 0.3 watt-hours of energy. A typical ChatGPT request takes 2.9 watt-hours. Multiply that difference by the 9 billion internet searches each day and that would increase the electricity demand by 10 terawatt-hours a year which is the same amount used by about 1.5 million European residents.</a> Even leaders in the industry are admitting that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00478-x">AI is facing an energy crisis without a breakthrough.</a></p>
