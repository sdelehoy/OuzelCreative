              <p>
                Networking events can feel intimidating. Maybe you’re shy. Maybe
                you don’t know what to say. Or maybe you just don’t see the
                point.
              </p>
              <p>
                But here’s the thing: Networking doesn’t have to be awkward. It
                can be fun, easy, and even rewarding—if you go in with a plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem? No clear goal = no motivation. You show up, wander
                around, and leave feeling like you wasted your time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The solution? Set a simple, fun goal before you go. Something
                small. Something doable. Something that makes networking feel
                less like a chore and more like a game.

                Problem: "I'm Too Nervous to Network"
              </h3>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Solution:</span> Meet 3 new people. You don’t
                need to talk to everyone. Just 3 people. That’s it.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Why it works:</span> Small numbers feel less
                scary.
              </p>
              <p class="bold">How to do it:
                <ol class="list">
                  <li>
                    Walk up and say, "Hi, I’m [Name]. What brought you here
                    today?”
                  </li>
                  <li>Listen. Ask follow-up questions.</li>
                  <li>If the convo fizzles, smile and move on.</li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Bonus:</span> If you meet 3 people, you’ve
                already succeeded!
              </p>
              <h3 class="post-subheading-3">
                Problem: "I Don't Know What to Say"
              </h3>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Solution:</span> Learn something new. Your
                goal? Ask one interesting question and actually listen to the
                answer.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Why it works:</span> You're not "selling"
                yourself—you're learning.
              </p>
              <p class="bold">How to do it:
                <ul class="list">
                  <li>"What’s the coolest eco-project you’ve worked on?”</li>
                  <li>
                    "What’s one thing you wish more people knew about
                    sustainability?”
                  </li>
                  <li>"What’s your favorite way to reduce waste?"</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Bonus:</span> You’ll leave with new ideas
                (and maybe even a collaboration!).

                      <li>Getting a laugh out of someone</li>

                  </li>
