						<h3 class="post-section-heading">6 Ways Anyone Can Reduce Digital </h3>
            <p><span class="bold">Clean out Unneeded Data</span>—Data that is being stored in the cloud or on a website is occupying space on a server using energy. Avoid saving unnecessary duplicates of files on the cloud.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Reduce Your File Sizes on the Internet</span>—The more data that has to be transferred from the server to a user's computer the more energy is being used. Create only necessary and focused content that adds value and is needed. Make websites with 'clean' code, remove unused code, and minify code files.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Optimize Your Images</span>—Resize images to fit the dimensions needed for social media or your website. Modern file formats such as WebP can reduce file size compared to older formats, such as jpeg, without compromising quality. Use tools to compress or reduce file size <a href="#resources">(see resources below)</a>.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Reduce Animations</span>—Implementing animations on your website uses computer processing and thereby uses more power.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Reduce Videos</span>—Videos are the most data intensive content. A site with a video playing can be 10 to even 100 times heavier than one without. If the video is necessary on your website, make the file as small as possible and use play-on-demand rather than autoplay.</p>
            <p>During video calls only turn on your camera when it adds value. Consider turning off your camera when you are not presenting or talking during conference calls.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Recycle Electronic Devices</span>—If possible repair electronic devices and continue using them, or pass them on or sell them to someone who can use it. If they are passed their usable life, have them properly recycled by a certified recycler <a href="#resources">(see resources below)</a>. Devices contain toxic materials as well as precious and heavy metals.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Switch to Green Hosting</span>—If you own a website, choose a website hosting provider/cloud service that uses renewable energy. <a href="#resources">(see resources below)</a>.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Optimize SEO</span>—By optimizing for search engines on your website it helps people find what they are looking for on the internet quickly. It can reduce the amount of time and web pages during a person's search so that it uses less energy.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Improve User Experience</span>—One of the main goals of good user experience for a website is making the user journey as streamlined as possible. Intuitive navigation and easy to find information that people are searching for reduces energy wasted.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</span>—A CDN is a network of servers around the globe that allow you to cache your website files from your hosting provider closer to where your users are located. The less distanced data travels the less energy used. An added benefit is that it provides another  layer of security.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Consider Vector Images</span>—Vector images, such as SVG format, are generally smaller in file size than equivalent raster images. Things such as logos, icons, and illustrations can be a vector. Vectors also have the advantage of being able to be used in various sizes without pixelation.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Reduce Website Tracking</span>—Cancel analytics tracking on your website if you are not using the collected data.</p>
            <p>The journey of sustainability is one of incremental progress. It can be overwhelming trying tackle everything all at once or by yourself.
