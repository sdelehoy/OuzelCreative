                We inspire global stewardship by informing eco-conscious
                decisions with choices for digital and print media that reduce

                  I was having a problem with getting clarity between my B2B and
                  B2C offers. I was feeling disjointed and confused, but at the
                  workshop I really like how we went through the entire
                  wireframe of a website and super simplified it. Now I feel
                  like I can better work through my messaging because of the
                  workshop materials and the AI platform.

                  I spent a day in one of Katy's Messaging &amp; Messaging
                  workshops and it was a day very well spent! She walks you
                  through the struture of StoryBrand.ai and it was so cool to
                  see the results immediately. If you are ready to get clear on
                  your messaging, definitely pop into one of these workshops!
