              <hr class="post-line">
              <p class="callout">We inspire global stewardship by informing eco-conscious decisions with choices for digital and print media that reduce environmental impact because present and future people, flora and fauna deserve their place in a thriving ecosystem.</p>
              <hr class="post-line">
              <p>We recognize that we have an impact on the environment. Our commitment is to minimize that impact. To be fully transparent, we acknowledge that we are not perfect in this endeavor. Perfection is not the goal. However, <span class="italic">progress</span>, and reaching towards perfection is our goal.</p>
              <p>We believe that running a business should not come at the expense of peple and the planet.</p>
              <p>We believe that being sustainable doesn't come at the expense of good design. A project can implement earth-friendly choices and have a great end product.</p>

            <section>
              <h2>Our Why</h2>
              <p><span class="bold">Being Good Stewards.</span> We acknowledge that we share this planet with other creatures (such as the Ouzel), plants and people. Our environment is something that is shared and relied upon for survival by all. We aim to be good stewards of it so that others may continue to benefit and thrive.</p>
              <p><span class="bold">Necessary for Survival and Thriving.</span> Nature deserves to be protected as a crucial element to health and survivial. Clean water, soil and air are necessary for producing food for nourishing and sustaining life.</p>
              <p>Nature has been scientifically proven to be therapeutic for humans both mentally and physically. (A quick search on the benefits of nature will bring up numerous articles and research on the subject. If you would like to read more here are a couple of books we have read: <a href="https://www.florencewilliams.com/the-nature-fix">The Nature Fix</a> and <a href="https://time.com/5259602/japanese-forest-bathing/">Forest Bathing</a>.)</p>
              <p><span class="bold">Source of Inspiration.</span> We enjoy hiking, backpacking and bird watching. Exploring wild places and soaking in the beauty that surrounds us is an inspiration for our creativity. Creatures and plants continually influence our design choices and rejuvenate our ability to create beauty in our work. Birds have been vanishing at an alarming rate mostly due to human activities. We can't imagine a world without birdsong. We want to see natural sites and sounds protected so that they can continue to be enjoyed and explored by future generations.</p>
