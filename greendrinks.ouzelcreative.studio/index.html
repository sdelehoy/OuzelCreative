      <h2 class="fs-2">Land Acknowledgment</h2>
      <p>
        What connects us at Green Drinks is a concern for our shared environment
        and care for the Earth. The sustainability efforts we make today can’t
        be mentioned without recalling those who have come before us. We want to
        recognize and honor the original stewards of the Earth and the land we
        stand on today, the Native Americans. Fort Collins was home to the
        Hinono’eiteen (Arapaho), Tséts?hést?hese (Cheyenne), N?m?n?? (Comanche),
        Caiugu (Kiowa (Kai-wa)), ?ariks i ?ariks (Pawnee), Sosonih (Shoshone),
        Oc'eti S'akowin (Lakota) and Núuchiu (Ute) people. We are grateful to
        these tribes for their stewardship of the resources that we all enjoy
        today. We hope to honor their past as we move forward with our intention
        of becoming more responsible stewards of our environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The native tribes of Colorado and Wyoming endured many atrocities,
        including horrific killing during the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864 and
        forced removal from their lands. Many treaties were broken with the
        various tribes. Today only 2 reservations are still on Colorado land.
        Yet, their history is one of great strength and Native Americans are
        still active parts of our community. This includes Yunfa (youf-na)
        Soldier Wolf working with the Cache La Poudre National heritage area and
        authors like Robin Wall Kimmerer sharing her experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand that this land acknowledgment may not right the wrongs of
        the past, but we intend to support the Native American cultures and
        practices that still to this day are fighting to protect this planet
        from irreversible damage. We can’t do this without acknowledging what
        has happened.
